# LinkInsights

LinkInsights is a Streamlit-based project that allows users to input YouTube video links or website URLs and scrapes data or transcripts from the provided source. Using powerful Language Learning Models (LLMs) like Gemini Pro 1.5, LinkInsights provides various outputs, such as summaries, reports, or Q&A based on the content from the scraped data.

## Features

- **YouTube Video Transcripts**: Automatically fetches transcripts from YouTube videos.
- **Website Data Scraping**: Scrapes text data from websites to use for further analysis.
- **Text Summarization**: Generates concise summaries of the provided content.
- **Q&A Generation**: Enables users to ask questions based on the scraped content and receive intelligent answers.
- **Report Generation**: Create detailed reports from the content for further insights.

## How It Works

1. **Input the URL**: Provide either a YouTube video link or a website link.
2. **Data Scraping**: The application scrapes relevant data (transcripts or website content).
3. **LLM Processing**: The scraped content is fed into the Gemini Pro 1.5 LLM via LangChain to generate results.
4. **Outputs**: 
    - **Summarization**: A concise summary of the content is displayed.
    - **Q&A**: Ask questions and receive answers from the content.
    - **Report**: A detailed report is generated based on the content.
